## ShowUp.rocks

ShowUp is a web application designed for concert-goers to find out about nearby up-coming concerts and discover new artists based on their music tastes as well as a portal for local/underground bands to get the word out about their upcoming shows

Although the initial development of the project is focused on San Antonio and surrounding cities, the project does have the capability to be taken nationwide. 

Front end design uses HTML, CSS, Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery and Javascript, as well as implementation of the Bing image search and Google Maps API's. Back end development uses the Larvel PHP Framework, and mySQL(Database).
